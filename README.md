# VirtualTourist
An iOS application that allows users to get a random collection of photos through the Flickr API from any point on the map.
Built as part of the Udacity iOS Developer nanodegree

## Installation
Just download or the clone the repo and hit run.

## Usage
Then click down on the map in whatever location you'd like to see photos from and then click the annotation to be
led to a page filled with photos for that location

## Known Issues
Currently the newest version of the iOS simulator runs very slowly when handling views with large mapViews on them so it
may take a moment to get running properly on the simulator. You can however run it on your iOS device without any issue.
